        "\n",
        "The Sentence-Window retrieval technique is a simple and effective way to retrieve more context given a user query which matched some document. It is based on the idea that the most relevant sentences are likely to be close to each other in the document. The technique involves selecting a window of sentences around a sentence matching a user query and instead of returning the matching sentence, the entire window is returned. This technique can be particularly useful when the user query is a question or a phrase that requires more context to be understood.\n",
        "\n",
        "The [`SentenceWindowRetriever`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/sentencewindowretrieval) can be used in a Pipeline to implement the Sentence-Window retrieval technique.\n",
        "\n",
        "The component takes a `document_store` and a `window_size` as input. The `document_store` contains the documents we want to query, and the `window_size` is used to determine the number of sentences to return around the matching sentence. So the number of sentences returned will be `2 * window_size + 1`. Although we use the term \"sentence\" as it's inertly attached to this technique, the `SentenceWindowRetriever` actually works with any splitter from the `DocumentSplitter` class, for instance: `word`, `sentence`, `page`.\n",
